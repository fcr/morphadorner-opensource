Text tokenization.
</h3>

<p>
Extracting words and sentences from a text are fundamental operations
required by other language processing functions. Word tokenization splits a
text into words and punctuation marks. Sentence splitting assembles the
tokenized text into sentences.
</p>

<p>
The first step in word tokenization is recognizing word boundaries. The
tokenizer uses white space such as blanks and tabs as the primary cue for
splitting the text into tokens. Punctuation marks are split from the
initial tokens. This is not as easy as it sounds. For example, when should
a token containing a hypen be split into two or more tokens? When does a
period indicate the end of an abbreviation as opposed to a sentence or a
number or a Roman numeral? Sometimes a period can act as a sentence
terminator and an abbreviation terminator at the same time. When should a
single quote be split from a word? Early modern English included many
contractions such as 'tis with a leading quote.
</p>

<p>
MorphAdorner's tokenizers use a number of heuristics and a list of
common abbreviations to produce a sequence of punctuation and spellings
that will be consistent with the subsequent operations of sentence boundary
identification, part of speech tagging, and lemmatization. Different part
of speech tag sets may require different tokenization. The Penn Treebank
tag set assumes contractions should be split into separate tokens. Thus the
token can't appears as two tokens, can and 't. The NUPOS tag set can work
with tokens split this way, but at present we prefer to keep contracted
forms as a single token. MorphAdorner includes tokenizers for each
approach.
</p>

<p>
Even when the text has been more-or-less correctly tokenized the
individual tokens may still be erroneous. The digital text of many Early
Modern English works was created using scanners and optical character
recognition (OCR) software. Such digitized text frequently contains all
manner of orthographic errors. Example include substitution of "~" for the
letters "m" or "n" and mapping of the archaic long "s" as the letter "f".
Some of these errors can be corrected automatically using heuristics and a
spelling standardizer.
</p>

<p>
In the print world, a punctuation mark does not count as a word.
Instead punctuation separates groups of words. In computer terms,
punctuation is a kind of "meta-data", not so qualitatively different from
SGML or XML markup. MorphAdorner's word tokenizers treat punctuation marks
as words. This procedure is justified because the punctuation "meta-data"
added by authors (or editors) lives at the same level of data as the words
and allows a consistent treatment of token transition probabilities for
adornment processes such as part of speech tagging.
</p>

<p>
All MorphAdorner word tokenizers must implement the
{@link edu.northwestern.at.utils.corpuslinguistics.tokenizer.WordTokenizer}
interface.  The
{@link edu.northwestern.at.utils.corpuslinguistics.tokenizer.WordTokenizerFactory}
provides the mechanism for instantiating a default or specified instance
of a WordTokenizer implementation.
The {@link edu.northwestern.at.utils.corpuslinguistics.tokenizer.AbstractWordTokenizer}
serves as a base class for deriving concrete implementations of
word tokenizers.
</p>

<p>
MorphAdorner word tokenizers may want to preprocess the text to regularize
white space or perform other operations before splitting the text
into tokens.  A word tokenizer can use invoke a class implementing the
{@link edu.northwestern.at.utils.corpuslinguistics.tokenizer.PreTokenizer}
interface for this purpose.  The
{@link edu.northwestern.at.utils.corpuslinguistics.tokenizer.PreTokenizerFactory}
instantiates a default or specified instance of a Pretokenizer implementation.
The {@link edu.northwestern.at.utils.corpuslinguistics.tokenizer.AbstractPreTokenizer}
serves as a base class for deriving concrete implementations of
pretokenizers.
