<h3>
Spelling standardization.
</h3>

<p>
English texts of the past exhibit far greater spelling variance than
contemporary texts. Texts from the seventeenth century and earlier times
use conventions that differ from contemporary standards in the use of "u"
and "v" and "y" and capitalization, among others. Often the same words is
spelled differently even within the same work. By the eighteenth-century
texts employ much more modern orthographic standards, except for
capitalization.
</p>

<p>
MorphAdorner uses rules, word lists, and extended search techniques
such as spelling correction methods and other heuristics to map variant
spellings to their standard (usually modern) form. For obsolete words no
longer in use, a representative standard form is chosen which is usually
the Oxford English Dictionary headword form. Presently MorphAdorner knows
about 336,000 variant spellings. Using this list, MorphAdorner can
automatically determine the correct standard form for previously unseen
spellings in many cases.
</p>

<p>
Sometimes a new spelling is just too different from any of the ones
MorphAdorner already knows. Using the extended search facilities on such a
spelling may result in a "standard spelling" which veers far from the
correct form. As time goes one we hope to reduce the occurrence of such
errors.
</p>

<p>
Orthographic standardization improves the quality of part-of-speech
tagging, name recognition, and text searching. However, standardization by
itself isn't sufficient to fix some other problems. These include the lack
of the apostrophe to mark the possessive case and the inconsistent
practices of capitalization as markers of proper nouns.

<p>
All MorphAdorner spelling standardizers must implement the
{@link edu.northwestern.at.utils.corpuslinguistics.spellingstandardizer.SpellingStandardizer}
interface.  The
{@link edu.northwestern.at.utils.corpuslinguistics.spellingstandardizer.SpellingStandardizerFactory}
provides the mechanism for instantiating a default or specified instance
of a SpellingStandardizer implementation.
The {@link edu.northwestern.at.utils.corpuslinguistics.spellingstandardizer.AbstractSpellingStandardizer}
serves as a base class for deriving concrete implementations of
spelling standardizers.
