Finds named entities in text.

<p>
Literary texts are filled with names of people and places.
MorphAdorner includes a simple name recognizer for extracting names to
allow building lists of characters and geographical settings.  MorphAdorner
uses simple rule-based pattern recognition methods along with
proper name word lists and gazeteers to locate probable names in
a text.
</p>
<p>
All MorphAdorner name recognizers must implement the
{@link edu.northwestern.at.utils.corpuslinguistics.namerecognizer.NameRecognizer}
interface.  The
{@link edu.northwestern.at.utils.corpuslinguistics.namerecognizer.NameRecognizerFactory}
provides the mechanism for instantiating a default or specified instance
of a name recognizer implementation.
You may extend the
{@link edu.northwestern.at.utils.corpuslinguistics.namerecognizer.AbstractNameRecognizer}
to create a new name recognizer.
